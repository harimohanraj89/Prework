# Ruby (25 hours)

Now we'll dig deeper into programming with a full-featured language: Ruby! It's very friendly to beginners and has all sorts of "syntactical sugar" -- little shortcuts that get more done with less code. We'll be using tons of Ruby throughout the course: it's a popular choice as a back-end language and a fundamental building block for a web application.  Fun fact: Ruby can also be used to write non-web programs.

###Resources:

- [Code School - Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/) - A short, fun interactive tutorial online.
- [Codecademy Ruby Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) - Please work through these sections.
- [Code School - Ruby Bits](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits) - Levels 1-3

###Assess Yourself:

Instead of attempting to install Ruby (and creating headaches at Installfest), test your chops with an online console at [REPL.it](http://repl.it/languages/Ruby) -- a tool for programming in Ruby online.

- Print out all the numbers from 1 to 100
- Create an array that holds 5 of your favorite things
	- Loop through that array and print out each one
- Write a method, greet, that takes a person's name as an argument and prints "Hello" plus that person's name (i.e. "Hello You!").
- Write a method, `double`, that takes a number `num` as an argument and returns 2 times that number.
- Write a method, `is_even?`, that takes a number num as an argument and returns `true` if it is even and `false` otherwise.
- Write a program/script that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
	- As it's running, print "Fizz" instead of the number if it's a multiple of 3.
	- For the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

**Be sure to test your code!**
